# tarot-card-analysis
This repository contains models I created(will add more in the future) for tarot card analysis.<br>
For text classification model(which i already finish), takes in a one sentence question and output a spread that can best answer the question.<br>
The dataset is generated with chatgpt-4o(since it's hard to get enough data from real human analysis). It was generated by providing chatgpt with information on each spread, and generate questions that are close related/can be solved by the spread.(spread infor from https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/learn-tarot-with-labyrinthos-academy) <br>
