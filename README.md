# tarot-card-analysis
This repository contains a simple model I created(will be adding more models related to tarot cards in the future when i got time) for tarot card analysis.<br>
-TEXT CLASSIFICATION MODEL:<br> Takes in a one sentence question and output a spread that can best answer the question.<br>
The dataset is generated with chatgpt-4o(since it's hard to get enough data from real human analysis). It was generated by providing chatgpt with information on each spread, and generate questions that are close related/can be solved by the spread.(spread info from https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/learn-tarot-with-labyrinthos-academy) <br>
